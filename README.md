# Kateâ€™s Web Widgets

These are little bits and pieces for HTML, CSS, Javascript (for DHTML) and such.  
What to call these? Web Widgets?

 * [Dotted contents](/demo/dotted)  
   How to implement dotted contents listings in CSS, and why it's a bad idea.

 * [Fold-down Expander](/demo/expander/)  
   A collapsable fold-down expansion clickable line, to show
   and hide details for things.

 * [Line Numbers](/demo/demo)  
   Automated line-numbering for `<pre>` elements, which are non-selectable during cut & paste.

 * [Form Validation](/demo/valid/)  
   Everybody has Javascript form validation. Here's mine.

 * [Sortable Tables](/demo/sorting/)  
   Automated sortability for `<table>` elements, with data types for columns identified
   automatically.

 * [XSLT Calendar](/demo/xslt-calendar/)  
   A monthly calendar, implemented in XSLT.

Generally I only try things out on Firefox and Chrome. I'd be surprised if
these work elsewhere.
